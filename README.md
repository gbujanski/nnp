This is a project I created to do something interesting that I have never done before. 
I don't have any creative ideas for a name, so this is a project without a name - no name project

There is nothing interesting here at the moment. Ultimately, it will be an application similar to slack/messanger/discord. I haven't decided yet which way it will go

It's a mess for now. I'm focusing on getting the basic things working. There will be time to clean up the code soon ;)

I'm not using the alembic for migration yet. This is just the beginning of this app and I decided to add the alembic later.

Also I'm not using any ui-kit like Vuetify. I decided that adapting a ready-made ui-kit to my requirements would take me more time than creating them from scratch.
